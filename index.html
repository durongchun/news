            <h3>The genetic similarities between two similar looking people</h3>
            <p>Manel Esteller, a molecular geneticist based at the Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Spain,
                tested the genetic similarities between the lookalikes depicted in French-Canadian photographer François
                Brunelle’s fascinating series “I’m not a look-alike!” which has been ongoing since 1999.
                <br><br>“He thought that I was crazy because usually artists do not receive calls from scientists,”
                Esteller
                remembered. Brunelle put Esteller in touch with the pairs of “twin strangers” from his photographs, from
                all over the world, who sent the researchers genetic samples in the form of mouth swabs. Esteller and
                his team spent four years collecting and correlating the genetic data before publishing the results in
                2022.
                <br><br>First they identified which of the lookalikes actually looked the most alike.
                <br>“It was very objective,” Esteller says. “These people were run [through] three facial algorithms,
                the same used by police and in airports,” and the ones that were algorithmically indistinguishable from
                actual identical twins were selected for further study.
            </p>

            <p>Molecular geneticist Manel Esteller used facial recognition software to identify similar looking
                strangers. Their DNA revealed the same genetic variants were responsible for their shared physical
                features.
