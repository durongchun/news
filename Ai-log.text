How can I dynamically update the background image of a main article element and swap it with a hidden image for synchronization?

To dynamically update the background image of a main article element and synchronize it with a hidden image, you can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. Here's an example code snippet and explanation:
Code Explanation
javascript
Copy code
// Set the main article's background image to match the article image's source
mainArticle.style.backgroundImage = `url("${articleImage.src}")`;
// Check if the main hidden image exists
if (mainArticleImage) {
  // Swap the current article image's source with the hidden main article image
  articleImage.src = mainArticleImage.src;
  // Extract the background image URL and set it as the source for the hidden image
  mainArticleImage.src = mainBgImage
    .replace(/^url\(["']?/, "") // Remove url() wrapper or quotes from the string
    .replace(/["']?\)$/, ""); // Clean up the ending
}
What the Code Does
Set the Background Image:
Updates the mainArticle element's backgroundImage property using the src attribute of an articleImage element.
Image Synchronization:
If a hidden image (mainArticleImage) exists:
Swaps the articleImage's src with the hidden image's src.
Updates the hidden image's src with the URL from the mainArticle's backgroundImage.
Background URL Parsing:
Uses replace() to clean up the url() format by removing wrappers like url("...") or url('...').
This approach ensures that the main article's background image and the hidden image are synchronized, making it possible to manage or preload images efficiently. This can be used in dynamic content scenarios like blogs, news websites, or media galleries.

I used ChatGPT for some git knowledge and contianer method.
Q: how can I want all text in my article not go out the article container, if adjust screen, the text just go next line
ChatGPT:
To ensure that the text in your article stays within the container and wraps to the next line when the screen is resized, you can use the following CSS properties:
1.Use word-wrap or overflow-wrap to ensure that the text will break when necessary (especially for long words).
2.Set the width of the container to ensure it scales with the screen size.
Q: if I want previous version from git, how can I write the command
ChatGPT said:
To retrieve a previous version from Git, you can use the git checkout or git reset command, depending on what you're trying to achieve. Here are a few ways to go about it:
1. Checkout a Specific Commit (Detached HEAD)
To switch to a previous commit without changing your current branch:
bash
Copy code
git checkout <commit-hash>
Replace <commit-hash> with the specific commit hash you want to check out. You can find the commit hash by running git log.
2. Checkout a Branch at a Specific Commit
If you want to checkout a branch at a previous commit, you can use:
bash
Copy code
git checkout <commit-hash> -b <new-branch-name>
This will create a new branch from that commit.
3. Reset to a Previous Commit (and Keep Changes)
If you want to reset your current branch to a previous commit but keep the changes in your working directory:
bash
Copy code
git reset <commit-hash>
4. Hard Reset (Discard Changes)
If you want to completely discard changes and reset your branch to a previous commit:
bash
Copy code
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
This will reset the branch and delete any changes made since that commit.
5. Revert a Commit
If you want to create a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit:
bash
Copy code
git revert <commit-hash>
